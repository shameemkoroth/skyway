			 <div class="location-detail" id="bali">
  		  <h1>Bali</h1>
  		  <p>Bali is a destination where natural beauty meets spiritual depth. To match the island's captivating scenery, the range of accommodations is simply outstanding. Whether you seek a luxurious beachfront resort, a stylish affordable hostel, or a private villa rented at an unbelievably good value, Bali has mastered the art of hospitality.

			 <div class="location-detail" id="dubai">
  		  <h1>Dubai</h1>
  		  <p>Dubai is an ideal holiday destination for families, with theme parks, beaches, Friday brunches and more to keep everyone happy. The famous Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world, is well worth the entrance fee. Burj Al-Arab, often touted as the world's only 7-star hotel, remains underwhelming. Similarly, the Aquaventure Water Park at the Palms Atlantis Hotel is not to be missed. Jumeriah Beach Residence is well established as Dubai's most popular beachfront, and its close proximity to a whole host of restaurants, cafes and shops make it more than worthy of its status.</p>

			 <div class="location-detail" id="geneva">
  		  <h1>Geneva</h1>
  		  <p>The charming city of Geneva comes with a plethora of attractions and tremendous natural beauty that makes every traveler fall in love with it. However, because of this overabundance of attractions, it becomes difficult for the backpackers to determine where to go first. Most of them generally miss out on all the best things that this fantastic city has to offer. The capital of Switzerland and a beautiful lakeside city, Geneva is home to many international organisations like the UN.</p>

        <h1>Port Blair</h1>
        <p>Port Blair is an alluring destination for tourists as it includes a host of attractive locales. There are shimmering but clean beaches, beaches that defy the ferocity of sea and let tourists swim leisurely, relics of colonial power and oppression, many must-go museums, libraries, coral reefs, and more.</p>
