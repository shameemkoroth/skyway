  <!-- What you need to know about Malaysia Visa -->
  <section>
    <h2>What You Need to Know: Visa vs. Visa-Free Entry</h2>
    <p>Before applying, understand the current entry requirements for Indian citizens.</p>
    <p>A <b>Malaysia Visa</b> is an official entry permit—a stamp in your passport or an electronic confirmation—that allows you to stay in Malaysia for specific purposes like tourism, business, or education. However, current regulations offer a great benefit for short stays:</p>
    <div class="highlight">
        <h3>&#9733; Good News: Visa-Free Entry for Indian Citizens (Up to 30 Days) &#9733;</h3>
        <p>Currently, Indian citizens can travel to Malaysia for <strong>tourism, business, or social visits</strong> for up to <strong>30 days per entry without a visa</strong>.</p>
    </div>

  <!-- Key Requirement -->
  <section>
    <h3>Key Requirement: The Malaysia Digital Arrival Card (MDAC)</h3>
        <p><strong>Mandatory for ALL entries!</strong> Even with the visa-free policy, you <em>must</em> complete the <strong>Malaysia Digital Arrival Card (MDAC)</strong> before your arrival. Skyway can guide you through this simple process to ensure a smooth entry.</p>

  <!-- FAQs -->
  <section>
    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about Malaysia Visa for Indians</h2>
    
    <details>
      <summary>1. How do I choose the correct Malaysian visa category?</summary>
      <p>Indian travelers have access to several categories, including Tourism, Business, Study, Employment, and Transit visas. You must select the visa that precisely matches your primary reason for travel. Selecting the correct category is essential, as the requirements, required documentation, and processing times vary significantly between them.</p>
    </details>
    
    <details>
      <summary>2. How much does an Azerbaijan Visa cost for Indians?</summary>
      <p>The visa fee varies based on the type of visa (e.g., tourist or business) and the processing speed selected (regular or urgent). To find out the current visa fees and special offers, please contact Skyway directly.</p>
    </details>
    
    <details>
      <summary>3. Is the Malaysia eVisa different from a regular visa?</summary>
      <p>Yes. The Malaysia eVisa is specifically designed to simplify the process for certain purposes, mainly tourism. Business and transit travelers often need to apply for a standard sticker visa through the Malaysian embassy, which involves more extensive documentation and a longer finalization period. Your travel purpose determines the required visa type.</p>
    </details>
    
    <details>
      <summary>4. How much does a Malaysia visa cost for Indian citizens?</summary>
      <p>The cost varies based on the specific visa you select (eVisa, Tourist, Business, etc.). You can find the most current and specific fee structure on the official Malaysian visa portal or by consulting with a trusted agency like Skyway.</p>
    </details>
    
    <details>
      <summary>5. How long does the visa processing take?</summary>
      <p>Processing time depends on the visa type: eVisas typically take between 2–3 working days, while standard embassy sticker visas can take 5–15 working days. We strongly recommend submitting your application well ahead of your planned travel date, especially during peak season, to minimize anxiety and ensure a smooth process.</p>
    </details>
    
    <details>
      <summary>6. Can I track my visa application status online?</summary>
      <p>Yes, you can track your application status using the online platform. You'll need your application reference number to get live updates throughout the process. Keep this reference number safe, as it's your tool for a hassle-free tracking experience.</p>
    </details>
    
    <details>
      <summary>7. What documents prove sufficient funds for Indian tourists?</summary>
      <p>Indian tourists must provide financial documents, typically 3-6 months of bank statements, to demonstrate stable and sufficient funds for the duration of the trip. Supporting documents like traveler’s checks and credit card statements can also help confirm your financial stability to cover lodging and daily expenses in Malaysia.</p>
    </details>
    
    <details>
      <summary>8. Do Indian tourists need to show proof of onward travel?</summary>
      <p>Yes, Indian tourists must present evidence of their departure plans, such as a confirmed return flight ticket or a ticket to an alternative onward destination, as mandatory proof that they will leave Malaysia after their authorized stay.</p>
    </details>
    
    <details>
      <summary>9. What are the requirements for Indian citizens traveling for medical tourism?</summary>
      <p>If you're visiting for medical tourism, you will likely need to provide medical reports, an appointment letter from the Malaysian hospital, and proof of sufficient funds to cover your medical expenses. It is also recommended to have a referral letter from your doctor in India. Always check the latest specific requirements with the Malaysian embassy.</p>
    </details>
    
    <details>
      <summary>10. Can Indian business owners get a long-term, multiple-entry visa?</summary>
      <p>Yes, business owners who frequently travel to Malaysia for work can apply for a multiple-entry business visa. This allows you to enter and leave Malaysia repeatedly during the visa's validity period. You must provide clear evidence of your ongoing business operations and the necessity for regular cross-border travel.</p>
    </details>
    
    <details>
      <summary>11. What is required if I attend a business conference in Malaysia?</summary>
      <p>You must obtain an official invitation letter from the event host. This letter must clearly state the conference details, your role/tasks, and your planned duration of stay. This document is crucial proof of your business travel purpose for the visa application.</p>
    </details>
    
    <details>
      <summary>12. Are there limitations on bringing business samples or tools into Malaysia?</summary>
      <p>Yes, business samples and equipment may face limitations. Before traveling, you must verify Malaysian customs regulations and import/export restrictions. Certain items may require special authorization or be subject to tax obligations. We advise contacting Malaysian customs authorities or the embassy for complete information.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>13. What are the tax implications for long-stay business travelers?</summary>
      <p>Indian business travelers staying in Malaysia for extended periods should be aware of potential tax obligations that may apply to their activities. It is essential to consult with a tax professional specializing in international law to fully understand and comply with any possible tax liabilities.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>14. Are temporary work permits required for short-term projects?</summary>
      <p>Yes. Even with a business visa, Indian business travelers conducting short-term projects in Malaysia may be required to obtain a temporary work permit. Regulations vary based on the specific project. You must consult with Malaysian immigration authorities to understand the exact requirements for your business activity.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>15. Can past immigration issues affect my application?</summary>
      <p>Yes, a history of overstaying a visa or other immigration violations in any country may negatively impact your Malaysia visa application, as Malaysian authorities consider past compliance history. It is best to be truthful and provide any supporting documents that may help your case.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>16. Are there restrictions on tourist activities?</summary>
      <p>Yes. Indian citizens on a tourist visa are strictly limited to leisure, sightseeing, and recreational activities. You are absolutely forbidden from engaging in any form of paid work, employment, or business activities while on a tourist visa.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>17. What are the rules for bringing prescription medication?</summary>
      <p>You must carry both your prescription and a medical letter from your doctor for any prescription medication you bring into Malaysia. Be aware that some medications may be restricted, so you should verify any specific drug with Malaysian health authorities well before your trip.</p>
